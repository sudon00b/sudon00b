# 🌩️ Sudhakar's Cloud & DevOps Portfolio

Welcome to my Cloud and DevOps portfolio! This is my personal space to learn, build, and showcase projects, experiments, and ideas in the world of cloud computing and DevOps.

I specialize in cloud-native technologies, CI/CD, and Infrastructure as Code. This portfolio serves as my public lab and resume — a place where I document what I’ve done and what I’m exploring next.
